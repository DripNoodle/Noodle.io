🚫 Usage Notice  
Seriously… **don’t use this.**  
This project is for **my own research and testing**.  
It’s not a public service. It’s not a product. It’s not for you.  
It’s here because GitHub makes things easy to deploy.

If you clone, fork, or run this tool without knowing what you're doing,  
you’re probably violating a Terms of Service *somewhere*.
